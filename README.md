# Accord:

Since 2007, the high-energy physics theory community has adopted an [agreement](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/itp/postdoc-agreement.html) in which institutions have pledged to set a common postdoc acceptance deadline. This agreement has been critical for establishing a standard of equity and fairness in hiring and recruiting practices, allowing several generations of postdocs to make life and career decisions with the maximum amount of information at their disposal.
The purpose of this new accord is to amend the date of the common acceptance deadline from January 7 to February 15, based on a community survey summarized in [this arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02683)
submission. **If your department would like to announce its adoption of the agreement, please send an email to het.postdoc.deadline [at] gmail [dot] com with the name of your institution and representative.**


### Terms:

Signatories of this accord hereby agree to the following:

1. The signatory, on behalf of their research group, agrees to make no postdoctoral offer
whose deadline for acceptance is earlier than February 15th for a position which
starts later that calendar year.
2. The accord will be signed by the current head of the research group or a representative
thereof, on behalf of the research group as whole. It is understood that the signature
remains valid if the group leadership rotates to somebody else, unless the signature
is withdrawn explicitly.
3. To ensure community unity, the new accord will only take effect once at least 75
institutions sign this agreement. If the **75 institution** threshold has not been
reached by **September 30th 2023**, the current January 7th accord will
remain in effect for the 2024 job cycle. This webpage will be kept up to date
with the current list, and all signatories will be notified by e-mail when the new
accord is either ratified or has failed to gather enough signatures by the deadline
above.
4. Once ratified, the new February 15th accord will supersede the January 7th accord.
5. Once ratified, the new February 15th accord will remain active until a similar accord
has been signed to replace it.
6. The accord does not apply to multidisciplinary fellowships whose timing is outside
the control of individual research groups, such as e.g. the Marie Curie and other
institutional fellowships.

### Footnote
As of December 22nd, 2017 there were more than 90 institutions signed up to the January 7th agreement,
although more institutions follow the agreement.
