# Accord:

Since 2007, the high-energy physics theory community has adopted an [agreement](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/itp/postdoc-agreement.html) in which institutions have pledged to set a common postdoc acceptance deadline. This agreement has been critical for establishing a standard of equity and fairness in hiring and recruiting practices, allowing several generations of postdocs to make life and career decisions with the maximum amount of information at their disposal.

Any fixed date for a common deadline is a compromise between advantages and disadvantages. A broadly distributed survey, reported in [this arXiv submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02683), shows that the
community now favors a substantially later date than previously agreed upon. This accord therefore amends the original agreement, changing the common acceptance deadline
from January 7th to February 15th. If your research group wishes to affirm this new accord, please email het.postdoc.deadline [at] gmail [dot] com with your name and that of
the research group you represent.


## Terms:

Signatories of this accord hereby agree to the following:

1. The signatory, on behalf of their research group, agrees to make no postdoctoral offer
whose *acceptance deadline* is earlier than **February 15th** for a position which starts
later that calendar year.
2. The accord will be signed by the current head of the research group or a representative
thereof, on behalf of the research group as a whole. It is understood that the signature
remains valid if the group leadership rotates to somebody else, unless the signature
is withdrawn explicitly.
3. To ensure community unity, the new accord will only take effect once both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
* At least 65 of the signatories of the existing January 7th accord (∼70%) have
signed on to this new accord.
* A total of at least 100 research groups have signed on to the new accord. This
exceeds the number of signatories of the previous accord.
<br/><br/>Moreover, for the accord to apply to the 2023-2024 hiring cycle, both criteria must
be met on or before **September 30th 2023**. If the criteria are instead met between
October 1th 2023 and June 30th 2024, this accord will go in effect for the 2024-2025 hiring
cycle. If the criteria are not satisfied before June 30th 2024, this accord and all its
signatures are to be considered null and void. The existing January 7th accord will
remain in force until the new accord is ratified.
This webpage will be kept up to date with the current list, and all signatories will
be notified by e-mail when the new accord is either ratified or has failed to gather
enough signatures by the deadlines above.
4. Once ratified, the new February 15th accord will supersede the January 7th accord
for those institutions who have signed both accords. The new February 15th accord
will remain active until a similar accord has been signed to replace it.
5. The accord does not apply to multidisciplinary fellowships whose timing is outside
the control of individual research groups, such as e.g. the Marie Curie and other
institutional fellowships.
